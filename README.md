## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I chose this project to practice my grid skills and to dip my toes into Tailwind and see what all the fuss was about. Needless to say, I believe I am hooked on this framework. The utility class names were super intuitive and the documentation by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is great.
